Parse out and store characters from their numeric values. 
For each character, we want to know how many times it occurs in the file? 
	        For each character, how many times is it paired with a prime number?
	        What character has the highest average of prime numbers? 
	        Rank the characters based on their prime number percentage. 
                        Are there invalid cells? If so, let us handle by serving a warning and maintaining an error count.
